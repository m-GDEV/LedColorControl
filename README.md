# LedColorControl

A Python script grabs the dominant colour of your screen, sends it to an ESP32, and the ESP32 transmits it to the LED strip.

## Roadmap 
- [ ] Different methods of determining the dominant colour
- [ ] Real-time (every ~50ms) colour updates
- [ ] Option to serially transmit colour information from ESP32 to LED strip
- [ ] Option to wirelessly transmit colour information from ESP32 to LED strip
- [ ] Option to send one dominant colour to LED strip or send multiple colours (LEDs are individually addressable)
